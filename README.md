# Constructors

- Initialization of Objects: A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is called when an object of that class is created, and it allows the object to be set up with initial values.

- Same Name as Class: A constructor must have the same name as the class it belongs to and does not have a return type, not even void.

### Types of Constructors:

- Default Constructor: A constructor provided by Java if no other constructors are explicitly defined. It has no parameters and initializes the object with default values.
- Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that takes arguments to initialize an object with custom values at the time of creation.
- Constructor Overloading: Java allows constructor overloading, where a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This provides flexibility to initialize objects in different ways.
